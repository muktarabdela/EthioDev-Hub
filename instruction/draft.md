## Additional requirements

1. **Project setup**

   - All new components should go in `/components` at the root (not in the app folder) and be named like `example-component.tsx` unless otherwise specified.
   - All new pages go in `/app`.
   - Use the Next.js 14 app router.
   - All data fetching should be done in a server component and pass the data down as props.
   - Client components (useState, hooks, etc.) require that `'use client'` is set at the top of the file.

2. **Server-Side API Calls**

   - All interactions with external APIs (e.g., Reddit, OpenAI) should be performed server-side.
   - Create dedicated API routes in the `pages/api` directory for each external API interaction.
   - Client-side components should fetch data through these API routes, not directly from external APIs.

3. **Environment Variables**

   - Store all sensitive information (API keys, credentials) in environment variables.
   - Use a `.env.local` file for local development and ensure it's listed in `.gitignore`.
   - For production, set environment variables in the deployment platform (e.g., Vercel).
   - Access environment variables only in server-side code or API routes.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**

   - Implement comprehensive error handling in both client-side components and server-side API routes.
   - Log errors on the server-side for debugging purposes.
   - Display user-friendly error messages on the client-side.

5. **Type Safety**

   - Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures, especially API responses.
   - Avoid using `any` type; instead, define proper types for all variables and function parameters.

6. **API Client Initialization**

7. **Data Fetching in Components**
   - Use React hooks (e.g., `useEffect`, `useState`) for client-side data fetching.
   - Implement loading states and error messages during data fetching.
